Compilation and installation procedure using OPAM
-------------------------------------------------

Requirements:
- Opam (https://opam.ocaml.org/)

Procedure:
- step 1/2: opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
  or opam update # if repository coq-released already added
- step 2/2: opam install --jobs=N coq-color

Compilation time: about 6'.

Remark: to use a CoLoR file in your development, you need to prefix it
with CoLoR and its complete path from the root directory of CoLoR. For
instance, for LogicUtil, you need to write CoLoR.Util.Logic.LogicUtil.

Enjoy!
