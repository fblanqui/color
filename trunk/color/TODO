- vm_compute: make sure that the calls to vm_compute are really necessary

- MI: try to improve performance

- MPO: remove MPO hypotheses (put them into a section?)

- RPO: solve problems with decidability procedure
(dealing with RPO for concrete terms)

- RPO: support for Rainbow

- DP: add improvement to DP pairs by ignoring pairs where rhs is a subterm of lhs

- AF: extend by allowing collapsing argument filterings

- General: make problem statement (including signature)
explicit at every proof step

- define strategies

- Eqdep uses an axiom: it is still used in ATerm and ACap (grep Eqdep)
and in the tactic Funeqtac.
is it possible to get rid of it by using Eqdep_dec only?

- replace defs and lemmas when they are added in coq std lib

- replace decidability lemmas by boolean functions

Done list:
----------

- DP: improve by introducing DP symbols (sharp symbols)

- move ListExt into ListUtil and ListExtras?
