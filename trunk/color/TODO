- replace showArctic[BZ]IntOk by boolean test

- implement FC2

- implement usable rules

- use Qed in beq_*_ok ?

- replace dom_lt by nat_lt ?

- precedence termination ? (special case of RPO)

- unify Arctic and Arctic-Below-Zero methods

- factorize AMatrixInt and ABigMatrixInt

- replace andb_elim by some rewrite

- define hd_red_mod from hd_red_Mod

- hd_red_mod_min: replace direct_subterms by Vforall SN?

- hd_red_mod_min: needs to be symmetric?

- only defined symbols need to be marked

- replace plus by tail recursive plus

- replace rev by rev'

- MPO: remove MPO top level hypotheses -> make a functor

- RPO: solve problems with decidability procedure
(dealing with RPO for concrete terms)

- DP: add improvement to DP pairs by ignoring pairs where rhs is a
subterm of lhs

- make problem statement (including signature) explicit at every proof step

- define strategies

- replace defs and lemmas when they are added in coq std lib

Done list:
----------

- AF: extend by allowing collapsing argument filterings

- prove that red R is finitely branching

- remove from RelExtras the things already defined in RelUtil

- use RelUtil notations in RelExtras

- extend WF_sred_of_WF_red to red_mod

- remove the use of beq_dec and beqtac

- define eq_term_dec from beq_term

- absurd_hyp is OBSOLETE: use contradict instead.

- Eqdep uses an axiom: it is still used in ATerm and ACap (grep Eqdep)
and in the tactic Funeqtac. is it possible to get rid of it by using
Eqdep_dec only? yes

- DP: improve by introducing marked symbols

- move ListExt into ListUtil
