- move VecEq into VecOrd

- replace LexOrder by Lexico?

- define a feq generalizing the ones in ListUtil and FSetUtil

- in RelUtil, replace # by * and ! by +

- replace Add [Parametric] Morphism by Proper

- remove Implicit in Implicit Arguments

- define default_mi

- factorize the part of the proof that is similar in
   AFilterPerm.filter_cont_closed and
   AFilterPerm.red_incl_filter_red_rc.

- in BoundNat, replace bnat by nat_lt

- replace decidability lemmas by boolean functions
  in polynomial and matrix interpretations

- for polynomial monotony, check that, all coefficients are
  non-negative and that, for all i, there is a monomial [k_1,..,k_n]
  which coefficient is positive and such that k_i is positive too

- semantic labelling with booleans

- FC2

- usable rules

- precedence termination? (special case of RPO)

- unify Arctic and Arctic-Below-Zero methods

- factorize AMatrixInt and ABigMatrixInt?

- define hd_red_mod from hd_red_Mod

- only defined symbols need to be marked

- replace plus by tail recursive plus

- make problem statement (including signature) explicit at every proof step?

- replace defs and lemmas when they are added in coq std lib

- replace unary integers by binary integers (big nats)?

Done:
-----

- in AFilterPerm, prove that (map (@val (arity f)) (pi f) = raw_pi f)
  and define permut on raw_pi instead of pi.

- extend filter to red in case of permutations only

- remove MPO top level hypotheses -> make a functor

- extend Term/WithArity/AInfSeq.v to arbitrary relations (not only on
   terms) and rename it in to Util/Relation/InfSeq.v

- uniformize the various notions of bounded nat in NatUtil, and use a
   record definition for defining projections at the same time

- remove implicit arguments from tactic absolute_finite,
   fin_monotone_succ, prove_cc, etc.: Fs can be inferred from Fs_ok

- add improvement to DP pairs by ignoring pairs where rhs is a
  subterm of lhs

- add boolean function for rpo

- replace showArctic[BZ]IntOk by boolean test

- use Qed in beq_*_ok

- replace rev by rev'

- AF: extend by allowing collapsing argument filterings

- prove that red R is finitely branching

- remove from RelExtras the things already defined in RelUtil

- use RelUtil notations in RelExtras

- extend WF_sred_of_WF_red to red_mod

- remove the use of beq_dec and beqtac

- define eq_term_dec from beq_term

- absurd_hyp is OBSOLETE: use contradict instead.

- Eqdep uses an axiom: it is still used in ATerm and ACap (grep Eqdep)
  and in the tactic Funeqtac. is it possible to get rid of it by using
  Eqdep_dec only? yes

- DP: improve by introducing marked symbols

- move ListExt into ListUtil
