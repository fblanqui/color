CoLoR, a Coq library on rewriting and termination
-------------------------------------------------

The aim of this Coq library (Coq is a proof assistant developped at
INRIA available at http://coq.inria.fr/) is to provide the necessary
formal basis for certifying the termination proof candidates searched
and built by tools like CiME, AProVE, TTT, Cariboo, etc.

Among other things, it includes:

* libraries on useful data structures in Util/
	- List: lists
	- Vector: vectors
	- Multiset: finite multisets
	- Polynom: integer polynomials with multiple variables

* libraries on term structures in Term/
	- Varyadic: varyadic terms
	- WithArity: algebraic terms with symbols of fixed arity
	- SimpleType: simply typed lambda-terms with de Bruijn indices

* transformation techniques:
	- DP: basic dependency pairs theorem
	- Filter: arguments filterings
	- Conversion: conversions between term structures

* termination criteria:
	- PolyInt: polynomial interpretations
	- MPO: multiset path ordering
	- RPO: recursive path ordering
	- HORPO: higher-order recursive path ordering

The library is likely to evolve and include more developments quickly.
