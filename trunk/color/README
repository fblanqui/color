CoLoR, a Coq library on rewriting and termination
-------------------------------------------------

The aim of this Coq library (Coq is a proof assistant developped at
INRIA available at http://coq.inria.fr/) is to provide the necessary
formal basis for certifying the termination proof candidates searched
and built by tools like CiME, AProVE, TTT, Cariboo, etc.

Among other things, it includes:

- Util/List: a library on lists
- Util/Vector: a library on vectors
- Util/Multiset: a library on finite multisets
- Util/Polynom: a library on integer polynomials with multiple variables

- Term/Varyadic: a library on varyadic terms
- Term/WithArity: a library on algebraic terms with symbols of fixed arity
- Term/SimpleType: a library on simply typed lambda-terms with de Bruijn indices

- PolyInt: a proof of the termination criterion based on polynomial interpretations
- DP: a proof of the basic dependency pairs theorem
- Filter: a library on arguments filterings
- MPO: multiset path ordering
- RPO: recursive path ordering with lexicographic and multiset statuses
- Conversion: conversions between term structures
- HORPO: a proof the well-foundedness of HORPO

The library is likely to evolve and include more developments quickly.
