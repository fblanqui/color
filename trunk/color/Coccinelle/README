This is a modified version of Coccinelle-v8.2-bool obtained from
http://a3pat.ensiie.fr/pub/coccinelle-8.2.tar.gz on 26 October 2009.

The files have been slightly modified by:
- removing the directory ordinals,
- removing the files in the directory examples (but not the directory
  examples and its subdirectory cime_trace)
- removing all "Add LoadPath" instructions,
- defining every thing in Type instead of Set,
- adapting a few proof scripts to new Coq versions.

This also includes Sorin Stratulat's patch on the files
term_orderings/rpo.v and examples/cime_trace/rpo_extension.v
extending RPO precedence from an ordering to a quasi-ordering.
