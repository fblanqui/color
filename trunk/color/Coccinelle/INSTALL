Compilation and installation procedure
--------------------------------------

The compilation procedure that is provided hereafter requires a
UNIX-like operating system with the following commands (it also works
with Cygwin on Windows):

- Coq version 8.4pl5 http://coq.inria.fr/
- GNU make version 3.81 http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
- GNU find version 4.4.2 http://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/findutils.html

For compiling the library, do 'make [-j N]'
(it takes 6'37" on my computer with N=10).

If you use the development version under SVN, before doing 'make', you
need to do 'make config' to recompile dependencies when new files are
added in the archive.

For installing the library in the default Coq user-contrib directory, do:
'make install'.

For installing the library in $dir, do: 'DSTROOT=$dir make install'.

For using the library without installing it, you need to type the following
command in Coq or add it in your ~/.coqrc file:

    Add Rec LoadPath "$dir" as Coccinelle_for_CoLoR.

where $dir is the installation directory.

For compiling the html documentation, do 'make doc'. The starting
file is doc/main.html.

For compiling the TAGS file, do 'make tags'. This requires 'coqtags'
from ProofGeneral (http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/).

If you encounter any problem, send a mail to Frédéric Blanqui
