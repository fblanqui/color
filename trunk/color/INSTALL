Compilation procedure
---------------------

The compilation procedure that is provided requires a UNIX-like
operating system with the following commands:

- Coq version 8.1pl1 http://coq.inria.fr/
- GNU make version 3.80 http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
- GNU bash version 3.00 http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/
- GNU sed version 4.1.4 http://www.gnu.org/software/sed/

Make sure that /bin/sh is bash.

Let MAKE be your command for make (usually: make or gmake).

For compiling CoLoR, use the command "MAKE all".

For compiling the html documentation, use the command "MAKE doc".

For compiling the TAGS file, use the command "MAKE tags". This requires:
- coqtags from ProofGeneral version 3.5 http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/
- GNU find version 4.2.24 http://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/findutils.html

For using the library, type the following command in Coq (you can also
add it in your ~/.coqrc file):

	Add Rec LoadPath "<dir>" as Rewriting.

where <dir> is the directory where the library is installed.

If you encounter any problem, send a mail to Frederic Blanqui
(name@loria.fr).
