Compilation procedure
---------------------

The compilation procedure that is provided hereafter requires a
UNIX-like operating system with the following commands (it also works
with Cygwin on Windows):

- Coq version 8.3pl4 http://coq.inria.fr/
- GNU make version 3.81 http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
- GNU find version 4.4.2 http://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/findutils.html

For compiling CoLoR, do: 'make' (it takes about 8 minutes on my computer).

If you use the development version of CoLoR under SVN
(http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/color/), after an update, before
doing 'make', you need to do 'make config' to recompile dependencies
when new files are added in the archive.

For compiling the html documentation, use the command 'make doc'. The
starting file is doc/main.html.

For compiling the TAGS file, use the command 'make tags'. This
requires 'coqtags' from ProofGeneral (http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/).

For using the library, type the following command in Coq (you can also
add it in your ~/.coqrc file):

	Add Rec LoadPath "<dir>" as CoLoR.

where <dir> is the directory where the library is installed.

If you encounter any problem, send a mail to Frederic Blanqui
(firstname.name@inria.fr).
