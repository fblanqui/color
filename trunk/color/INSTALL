Compilation and installation procedure
--------------------------------------

The compilation procedure that is provided hereafter requires a
UNIX-like operating system with the following commands (it also works
with Cygwin on Windows):

- Coq version 8.4pl5 http://coq.inria.fr/
- GNU make version 3.81 http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
- GNU find version 4.4.2 http://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/findutils.html

For compiling CoLoR, do: 'make [-j N]'
(it takes 6'37" on my computer with N=10).

(If you use the development version of CoLoR under SVN
(http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/color/), before doing 'make', you
need to do 'make config' to recompile dependencies when new files are
added in the archive.)

For installing CoLoR in the default Coq user-contrib directory, do:
'make install'.

For installing CoLoR in $dir, do: 'DSTROOT=$dir make install'.

For using CoLoR without installing it, you need to type the following
command in Coq or add it in your ~/.coqrc file:

    Add Rec LoadPath "$dir" as CoLoR.

where $dir is the CoLoR directory.

For compiling the html documentation, do: 'make doc'. The starting
file is doc/main.html.

For compiling the TAGS file, do 'make tags'. This requires 'coqtags'
from ProofGeneral (http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/).

If you encounter any problem, send a mail to Frederic Blanqui
(firstname.name@inria.fr).
